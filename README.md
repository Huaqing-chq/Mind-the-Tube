# Mind-the-Tube
Mind the Tube is a minimalist, TfL-styled web application that provides real-time London Underground service status using the official Transport for London Unified API. Designed to be fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly, it recreates the clean visual identity of the Tube while delivering up-to-date line information at a glance.
